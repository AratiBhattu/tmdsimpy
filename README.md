Tribomechadynamics Python Simulation Scripts 

This repository contains python files and functions for running numerical simulations for various tribomechadynamics problems. Files intended for experimental analysis are not included here and can be found elsewhere. Some specific analyses are provided as examples. Specific projects are based in other repositories and use these shared modeling routines as a dependency.

## Acknowledgments

In future - add details for citing the repository and/or relevant papers here.

## Usage

This repository is intended to be cloned into a repository to provide necessary functions that are used for many different modeling cases.

## Tests and Examples

All new routines added to this folder should have examples of how to use the routine added to the EXAMPLES folder and one or more tests to show that the expected results are produced added to the TESTS folder.

Test and example files should be named logically with informative file names. Comment at the top of the script which functions are being tested or used in the example.

Tests should output information to make it clear if the expected result is produced or not.

All analytically implemented gradients should have a test verifying them numerically.
