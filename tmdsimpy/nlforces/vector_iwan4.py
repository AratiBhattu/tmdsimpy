class VectorIwan4(Iwan4Force):
    """
    4-Parameter Iwan Element Nonlinearity with vectorized force calculations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Q : (Nnl, N) numpy.ndarray
        Matrix tranform from the `N` degrees of freedom (DOFs) of the system
        to the `Nnl` local nonlinear DOFs.
    T : (N, Nnl) numpy.ndarray
        Matrix tranform from the local `Nnl` forces to the `N` global DOFs.
    kt : float
        Tangential stiffness coefficient.
    Fs : float
        Slip force.
    chi : float
        Controls microslip damping slope. Recommended to have `chi > -1`.
        Smaller values of `chi` may not work.
    beta : float, positive
        Controls discontinuity at beginning of macroslip (zero is smooth).
    Nsliders : int, optional
        Number of discrete sliders for the Iwan element.
        Note that this does not include 1 additional slider for the
        delta function at phimax.
        Default is 100 (commonly used in literature).
    alphasliders : float, optional
        Determines the non-uniform discretization (see [1]_).
        For midpoint rule, using anything other than 1.0 has
        significantly higher error.
        The default is 1.0.

    See Also
    --------
    Iwan4Force :
        Standard implementation of the Iwan element, generally a slower
        implementation than the present class.

    Notes
    -----
    This class exploits the fact that only reversal points need to be
    calculated to reach steady-state.
    After that, all intermediate times can be calculated in parallel
    (vectorized here), to be faster.
    This does not change the results.

    This implementation is only tested for `Nnl == 1`.

    `local_force_history` implementation is the only difference relative to
    `Iwan4Force` for standard functions. This also adds a new function
    to help in calculations of `local_force_history_crit`, but that function
    should not be needed for must public calls.

    Iwan nonlinearity is based on [1]_.

        Modified `local_force_history` to pass out slider states as well

        Parameters
        ----------
        unlt : (Nt,Nnl) numpy.ndarray

            columns are different displacement DOFs.

            Evaluation of each harmonic component (columns) at a given instant
            in time (row = instant in time). These are without any harmonic

        unlth0 : (Nnl,) numpy.ndarray
            Zeroth harmonic contributions to a time series of displacements.
            This is passed to `init_history_harmonic` to initialize model.

            Number of times to repeat the time series to converge the 
            initial state with `local_force_history`.

            The default is 2.
        atol : float, optional
            Absolute tolerance on force time series convergence to steady-state
            (final state of cycle).
            The default is 1e-10.
        rtol : float, optional
            Relative tolerance on force time series convergence to steady-state
            (final state of cycle).

        Returns
        -------
        ft : (Nt,Nnl) numpy.ndarray

            is which local nonlinear force DOF.

            Derivative of forces with respect to displacement harmonic
            coefficients.

            Fourth index corresponds to which of the `Nhc` harmonic 
            components.

            The derivative of `fsliders` with respect to the harmonic
            coefficients of the displacement `unlt`.

        Notes
        -----

        Function is intended to be called for only a subset of the full times
        of a cycle. These times should just be the velocity reversal points.
        This allows to the calculation of those points more directly
        to improve the efficiency of `local_force_history`.

        Shapes of outputs rely on having `Nnl == 1`.
